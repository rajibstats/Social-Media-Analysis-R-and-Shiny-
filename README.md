# Social-Media-Analysis-R-and-Shiny-
Introduction

to develop a Social Media Dashboard, a platform for extracting, storing, tabulating and analyzing social media contents streamed through Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, for its internal use.  Dashboard interface should be designed as such to allow the manager to search and store/download content about new trending topic by merely using the designated hashtag or keywords. It should also allow the user to search in multiple languages.  

Focus should be more on how the collected content will be sorted, processed and analyzed. A particular attention should be given on sentimental analysis using latest visual tools. This is our rough vision but we are open to seek technical advise on the latest technology.


Extracting and Storing

At first stage, the dashboard will extract and store all the tweets and posts. Using the users, keywords and hashtags, the dashboard will initially extract and store the contents in relational database. The contents will be navigated based on three features; Accounts, Keyword and Hashtag.

Features:
1.	Tracking trends through navigating keywords, hashtags and any other criterion to be decided in consultation with development team. 
2.	Identifying verified and unverified users and accounts on social media platforms. 
3.	Identifying and determining human users vs machine users of the social platform; bots and APIs. 
4.	Providing the ability to navigate posts and tweets in local languages; Dari and Pashto. 
5.	Storing the extracted tweets and posts in central server and database of QARA platform. 
6.	Determining and identifying location of the users (breakdown by provincial, within the country and those engaging from outside the country)
7.	Determining the origin of the trend or movement.

Analysis

As the tweets and posts are extracted and stored neatly in the platform, the next stage will be to analyse posts using specific methods. We would specifically be interested in tracking specific trends on the social media. In order to elaborate further on how we envision the analysis to be performed, we would like to use a hypothetical example that closely illustrates the scope of the work.  The #metoo movement spread across social media that resulted in a mixed reaction of the users. Using #metoo movement as an example, we would specifically be interested to understand following aspects of the movement:

●	How have the users reacted and responded to #metoo?
●	How many users have engaged either for or against the movement across geographies?
●	How is the engagement of the users distributed based on demographic information; gender, age, education, political view, area of residence and etc? 
●	How is the movement evolving over time?
●	Has the movement influenced users in shifting their views from the initial impression? 
●	What specific trends has the #metoo movement resulted in on the social media? Has any other trend evolved as a result of #metoo?
●	Who have been most engaging and least engaging in the movement among the users? (Aggregation of demographic features of users; age, education, income, area of residence, gender and etc.)


Metrics

Volume 

•	Number of people/users using the keyword or hashtag? 
•	Distribution of users/people interaction with keyword and hashtag based on demography.

Reach

•	Number of Clicks?
•	Number of Posts?
•	Number of Likes?
•	Number of Shares?
•	Number of retweet and reply?


Engagement

•	How much groups and users have engaged with the post?
•	Using reach metrices, engagement is determined:
o	Engagement Percentage  = engagement numbers (Like, share and etc) / Accounts Reached * 100

•	Origin of the hashtag
•	Regions engaged in keyword or hashtag (Countries, cities, provinces)
•	Gender engaged in keyword or hashtag (Male or Female)
•	Age engaged in keyword or hashtag
•	Education engaged in keyword or hashtag
•	Number of bots or machines engaged?


Metrices to be considered for a hashtag or keyword

1.	Origin of the hashtag or keyword 
2.	Number of clicks based on user’s 
3.	Breakdown of the user by demographic information; gender, age, education, political view, area of residence. 
4.	Number of users interacted vs bots and machines interaction 
5.	User interaction mapping 
6.	VPN or direct connection

Visualization

The trends and insights derived from the data in analysis stage will be visualized to ensure it is easily to navigate insights. Visualization and communication of the insights is preferred to be simple and easy to use for non-technical users. There are two aspects of visualization that are of importance to us; comprehension and communication. 
The trends derived from analysis should be visualized in such a way that ensures the users understand and follow through the trends comprehensively. Since users of the dashboard may come from a non-technical background, it has to be ensured that the user interface is designed conveniently and easily navigable. In the meantime, the visualization would have to be presentable for communication. We might deem necessary communicating certain visuals with broader audience.
